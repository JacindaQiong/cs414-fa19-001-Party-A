Sprint Review: 

P1:

The main focus of this sprint was planning.

09/19-During our first scrum, we familiarized ourselves with the game Hnefatafl. We then read over the transcript in the P1 document that described what the client wants out of the Hnefatafl game system. From there, we created user stories based on the requirements and assigned them a time estimate.

09/24- During our next scrum, we created CRC cards based on these user stories. We also created a class diagram using the CRC cards as a reference. 

09/26 We then had a meeting with the professor/”product owner” to verify the user stories and discuss priorities. This also helped us gain a better understanding on what we needed to revise and complete by the end of the sprint.

P2:

10/11-During this scrum,we discussed the file content of P2 together and allocated the files within the file.

10/21-During this scrum,we asked the professor about the parts of the P1 document that could be improved.The task of file improvement was assigned. 

10/24-During this scrum,together, we solved the game's implementation of the code logic for the round, assigned code tasks based on the improved task and each person's familiar direction, and worked out the deadline.

10/31- 

Sprint Retrospective: 

What went well:

P1:Our scrum meetings contained good discussions that allowed us to gain a better understanding of the game and the system we needed to create. We also asked a lot of helpful questions, and left each meeting having accomplished something, while also having a plan of what we needed to do next. 

P2:Our scrum meetings discussed a lot of details about the implementation of the game, actively assigning tasks, making plans for each week and the next meeting time.

 What could improve:
 
 P1:We could improve on being clearer on who is going to complete certain things. For example, sometimes it was unclear on who was working on what, and this could cause problems such as people working on the same thing at once, or some things not being completed at all. We plan on fixing this problem by using Zenhub, which will allow us to create tasks and see which ones are currently being worked on and which are left for others to claim. We can also work on time management to ensure that we are utilizing as much time as possible throughout each sprint. Finding times where all 5 of us could meet was also somewhat difficult, and there would sometimes be meetings where not all members were present. We can solve this by planning our scrums a couple days in advance, so that we can determine a time that works for everyone.
 
P2：During the retrospective, we reflected on the work and code we had done this sprint and identified what we could improve on for the next sprint. While we made some changes based on what we thought we could improve on last time, such as communicating with each other more frequently, we can also continue working on things such as time management by updating the Kanban board/Zenhub more frequently. This will help with completing more tasks.
